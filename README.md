# Wireless-Sensor-Networks-Simulation
This repository contains a simulation of the LEACH protocol for wireless sensor networks, and also animations to visualize the clusters every round and the lifetime comparison with the direct protocol. This simulation is based on the paper "Energy-Efficient Communication Protocol for Wireless Microsensor Networks" and implemented in python.
